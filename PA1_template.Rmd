Reproducible Research: Peer Assessment 1
========================================================

## Loading and preprocessing the data

```{r}
setwd("~/Documents/R/RepData")
activity <- read.csv("~/Documents/R/RepData/activity.csv")
```


## What is  mean total numbers of steps taken per day

```{r}
total_steps<-aggregate(steps~date, data=activity, sum, na.rm="TRUE")
hist(total_steps$steps, xlab = "Steps", col = "Red", main = "Mean total numbers of steps taken per day")
steps_mean<-mean(total_steps$steps)
steps_median<-median(total_steps$steps)
steps_mean
steps_median
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?
```{r}
interval_steps<-aggregate(steps~interval, data=activity, mean, na.rm="TRUE")
plot(steps~interval, data=interval_steps, type="l")
max(interval_steps$steps)

```

## Imputing missing values

```{r}
colSums(is.na(activity))
new_value<-mean(activity$steps, na.rm="TRUE")
activity_new<-activity
activity_new$steps[is.na(activity_new$steps)] <- new_value
colSums(is.na(activity_new))

total_steps1<-aggregate(steps~date, data=activity_new, sum, na.rm="TRUE")
hist(total_steps1$steps, xlab = "Steps", col = "Red", main = "Mean total numbers of steps taken per day")
steps_mean1<-mean(total_steps1$steps)
steps_median1<-median(total_steps1$steps)
steps_mean1
steps_median1
```


## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends ?





You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r fig.width=7, fig.height=6}

```
